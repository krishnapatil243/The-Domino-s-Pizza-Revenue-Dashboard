# The-Domino-s-Pizza-Revenue-Dashboard
The Domino’s Pizza Revenue Dashboard is a data analytics project that analyzes sales data to uncover revenue trends, customer purchasing behavior, and product performance. Using interactive visualizations, the project highlights key metrics such as total revenue, order volume, average order value, top- and bottom-selling pizzas, and weekday .
This dashboard analyzes key metrics such as total revenue, average order value, number of orders, weekday-wise revenue, top- and bottom-selling pizzas, and performance across pizza categories and sizes. By presenting these insights in a clear and interactive format, the project demonstrates how business intelligence tools can be effectively used to evaluate performance and optimize operational and marketing strategies.
The results of this project show that Domino’s revenue is largely driven by high order volumes and a small set of top-selling pizzas, with medium and large sizes contributing the most to total sales. Weekend days generate higher revenue compared to weekdays, indicating strong customer activity during leisure periods, while mid-week sales present opportunities for targeted promotions. Additionally, the analysis identifies low-performing pizzas that contribute minimally to revenue, providing actionable insights for menu optimization. Overall, the dashboard delivers clear, practical insights that can help improve pricing strategies, inventory planning, and overall business performance.
